# finplan_sim

**finplan_sim** is a personal Python learning project by Ralf Ehret, focused on building a modular financial planning simulator.  
It serves both as a sandbox for exploring Python (object-oriented design, data modeling, pandas, etc.) and as a practical tool to simulate real-life financial scenarios â€” such as retirement planning, real estate investment, loan repayment, and cash flow forecasting.

The goal is to develop a reusable simulation framework based on structured configuration files (YAML), clear separation of concerns, and extendable components for various income, expense, and asset types.

This project is currently in **Work In Progress** (WIP) state and actively evolving.
